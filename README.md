Needs a gpt-3.5-turbo (or equivalent) paid API key from OpenAI set as an OS environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY, with the value being the actual key

Required packages: flask, openai, dotenv and python-dotenv. Python-dotenv HAS to be installed AFTER dotenv. Uninstall then reinstall python-dotenv while keeping dotenv if you get an error regarding dotenv not having an attribute find_dotenv
